# Partial Completion Reporting

- Many organizations use standard accounting systems with weekly time sheets to charge staff time to individual jobs.

- The staff time booked to a project indicates the work carried out and the charges to the project.

- however, It does not inform the project manager what has been produced or whether tasks are on schedule.

- It is therefore common to adapt or enhance existing accounting data collection systems to meet the needs of project control.

- Weekly time sheets, for example, are frequently adapted by breaking jobs down to activity level and requiring information about work done in addition to time spent.
