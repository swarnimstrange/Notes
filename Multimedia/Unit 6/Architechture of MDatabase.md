# General Architechture Of Multimedia Database

- In multimedia database retrieval of media elements will be determined by how they are stored in first place.

- Multimedia database consists of two levels of abstraction:

  - The physical level consisting of media objects themselves.
  - The logical level consisting of features characterizing the media objects.

- multimedia database consists of seperate databases:

  - A Media Database : a folder populated by media files
  - A feature Database : to be designed based on the type of information it contains.

- Indexing Mechanism -:

  - Sequential scan for hundreds of objects is adequate for multimedia databases similarity computation are non-trivial, indexing mechanism required for large databases for large database sizes.

- Characteristics of Multimedia Database System -:
  - Specialized Hardware
  - Scheduling Activities
  - Client Interface
  - Quality factors
