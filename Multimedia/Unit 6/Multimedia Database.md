# Multimedia Database System

- Multimedia database is collected of media elements like text, images, audio and video can be stored, manipulated and retrieved.

- Architechture is complicated than normal database as an images should be unambiguously described.

- Storage and Retrieval of Multimedia

  - Textual Annotation -:

    - Database populated before its usage.
    - Multimedia database is defined as data structure which enables searching and retrieval of textual as well as non-textual media like image, audio, video.

  - Low level Features -:

    - To overcome limitations of textual annotations.
    - Extraction of low level features like color, shape, loudness, pitch etc. from media component in unsupervised and semi supervised manner.

  - Semantic Features -:

    - In CBSR systems, queries are answered using semantic nature of media content.
    - Low level features could not be effective as media contents interpreted by humans and machine differs.

  - Knowledge-based interpretation
    - As system cannot interpret what features or objects means, extraction and represention of low level features and semantic object is not enough to correctly handle user queries.
    - statistical methods are used to analyze and deduce unknown parameter of system.
