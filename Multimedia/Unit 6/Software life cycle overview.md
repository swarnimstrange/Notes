# Software life cycle overview

- A software development process consists of steps that involve methods, tools and procedures

- These steps are called as life cycle model. The lifecycle starts at concepts building and ends on retirement.

- This enforces a discipline in the development process and generation of documents at every stage. The sofware lifecycle involves following steps:

  - Feasibility Study -:

    - The problem must be conceptualize before development. Client interaction is must to understand the requirements.
    - risk anaylysis, eliminating risks

  - Requirement analysis -:

    - the specification must be documented unambiguously.
    - Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is prepared.

  - Project Planning and management -:

    - Planning involves fixing budget, delivery schedules, list of deliverables.
    - Resource management is to split the project work and distribute it to appropriate set of production groups.

  - Designing -:

    - The entire project is devided into modules and each module is designed in this phase.

  - Implimentation -:

    - Actual coding begins
    - functionalities of modules are scrutinized

  - Integration -:

    - The individual modules are interconnected and interfacing problems are resolved, if any. the overall system is tested.

  - Delivery and Maintenance -:
    - The software is delivered to customer.
    - once customer accepts the software the maintenance phase starts.
