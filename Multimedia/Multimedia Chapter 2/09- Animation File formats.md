# Animation File formats

- ANI File Format

  - stands for Microsoft Windows Animated Cursor
  - ANI files are essentially a collection of BMP, CUR or ICO data combined together into a single file
  - with additional headers and directory information, and organized into a RIFF file
  - It Contains Color/Animated Cursor

- APNG File Format

  - APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a file format for storing bitmap animations.
  - It builds on the PNG file format with a backward-compatible design intended to allow older software that reads PNGs, to simply display the first frame of an APNG animation.
  - The advantage of using an APNG over GIF is that it allows 24 bit True Color, and alpha transparency
  - It Contains Bitmaps/Animation.

- EVA File Format

  - Stands for Extended Vector Animation.
  - EVA is a file format devised by Sharp Corporation in 1996, and apparently very popular in Japan.
  - It allows animations to be displayed using inside web-browsers using a special plug-in.
  - Contains Vector Animation

- FLA File Format

  - FLA is the the file format used in Adobe Flash Pro (formerly Macromedia Flash) for authoring in, and storing work that is still in progress or under development.
  - FLA files are converted into SWF format (for use with the flash player) before use on the Internet.
  - Contains Animation/Multimedia/Video

- GIF File Format

  - Stands for Graphics Interchange Format
  - This is a format developed by CompuServe Inc. for storing bitmaps.
  - GIF files can contain bitmaps at a variety of color depths: 2, 4, 16, or 256 color, in each case with a palette.
  - GIF files are compressed using an LZW compression scheme\
  - Contains Bitmaps/Animation

- MNG File Format

  - Stands for Multi-image Network Graphics.
  - MNG (pronounced "ming") is a format for storing multiple bitmaps and animations and is a close cousin of the PNG format.
  - When storing animations, MNG does not allow audio or video, but does include more sophisticated animation features than GIF, which help keep file size to a minimum.
  - Contains Bitmaps/Animation

- SWF File Format
  - Stands for Small Web Format.
  - This is a format originally devised by Macromedia (subsequently merged into Adobe) for storing animations (optionally including sounds), although it can also do a lot more than do animations (for example, process forms or even build entire web sites).
  - In order to play a SWF file in a user's browser, they must have a Flash plug-in installed, however most users do have this.
