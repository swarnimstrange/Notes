- Traditional animation (or classical animation, cel animation, or hand-drawn animation) is an animation technique in which each frame is drawn by hand.
- The technique was the dominant form of animation in cinema until computer animation.
- In this animation, every picture for a scene is created by hand if anyone loves to paint then traditional animation is very interesting for those people.
