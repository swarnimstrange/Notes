# 3D Animation

- 3D animation is the process of placing objects and characters in a 3D space and manipulating them to create the illusion of motion.
- The objects are made based on 3D models assimilated in a digital environment with 3D modeling tools.
- Alternatively, real-life objects can be scanned into a computer or an animation tablet and become blueprints for 3D animated objects.
- The goal of 3D animators is to move objects and characters in a given scene as realistically as possible.
- You can create the perfect cartoon character, but if its movements are uneven, robotic, or awkward, all your hard work will go down the drain
- That’s why animators spend quite some time studying the basic principles of motion to make their animations believable.
- 2D animation is flat as it’s based on a two-dimensional plane with x and y axes. With the help of an additional axis, 3D adds a perception of depth to animations, making them more realistic.

- Three main phases of 3D animation are -:
    - Modeling :
        - Before we can have a functioning scene with character interactions, we first need to build our 3D characters.
        - Characters are based on 3D computer models, and their creation is called 3D modeling.
    
    - Layout and Animation :
        - When the 3D characters are all set, it’s time for character animation — i.e., putting characters in their respective scenes and animating their movements with 3D animation software.
        - Such a rough first draft is produced because animators first create only the starting and ending poses of any motion. These poses are known as keyframes.
        -  The lighting, camerawork (picking the angles and depth of a shot), effects, and other details are added much later to achieve the final, smooth animation that we see on our screens.

    - Rendering :
        - The last part of the animation production process is rendering.
        - This is when the animation is finalized and exported.
        - This step requires great attention to detail to ensure the final render is perfectly polished. 
        - Here, the main production process ends and is followed by post-production, where special effects, music, voice-over, and sound effects are added and synchronized with the whole animation.
