# Principles of Animation

1. Stach and Squase-:

   - This principle works over the physical properties that are expected to change in any process.
   - Ensuring proper squash and stretch makes our animation more convincing.
   - For Example: When we drop a ball from height, there is a change in its physical property. When the ball touches the surface, it bends slightly which should be depicted in animation properly.

2. Anticipation:

   - In Anticipation, we make our audience prepare for action. It helps to make our animation look more realistic.
   - For Example: Before hitting the ball through the bat, the actions of batsman comes under anticipation. This are those actions in which the batsman prepares for hitting the ball.

3. Staging:

   - Staging is defined as the presentation of the primary idea, mood or action.
   - Animator creates such type of scene which attract audience so that audience’s attention is directed toward that scene.
   - The purpose of defining principle is to avoid unnecessary details and focus on important features only.
   - The primary idea should always be clear and unambiguous.

4. Straight Ahead Action and Pose to Pose.

   - Straight ahead action scenes involve animating each frame from beginning to end.
   - Do this to create a fluid illusion of movement for action scenes, but not if you want to create exact poses with proportions maintained.
   - With pose to pose, animators start by drawing key frames and they fill in the intervals later.
   - Because relation to surroundings and composition become more important, this approach is preferable for emotional, dramatic scenes.

5. Follow Through and Overlapping Action.

   - Follow through concerns the parts of the body that continue to move when a character stops.
   - Parts of the body don’t move at the same rate and overlapping action demonstrates this.
   - For example, you could have a character’s hair moving during the momentum of action and when the action is over, it continues to move a fraction longer than the rest of the character.

6. Ease In, Ease Out:

   - This animation principle is also known as ‘slow in and slow out’.
   - In the real world, objects have to accelerate as they start moving and slow down before stopping.
   - For example, a person running, a car on the road or a pendulum.

7. Arcs:

   - In real life, most actions have an arched trajectory.
   - To achieve greater realism, animators should follow this principle.
   - Whether you’re creating the effect of limbs moving or an object thrown into the air, movements that follow natural arcs will create fluidity and avoid unnatural, erratic animation.

8. Secondary Action:

   - This principle of animation helps emphasise the main action within a scene by adding an extra dimension to your characters and objects.
   - Providing they don’t take attention away from the main action, secondary actions can really bring a scene to life.

9. Timing:

   - As in real life, animation is all about timing.
   - Get this principle right and it grounds your animation in realism, as everything will appear to follow the laws of physics.
   - for example, A lightweight person or object is going to react quicker to being pushed than a heavy one.

10. Exaggeration:

    - Disney believes that exaggeration should be true to reality to an extent, but made more extreme - often pushed just beyond the realms of realism, to make their characters pop and add fun to their adventures.
    - A classic trope and great example of exaggeration in animation is the jaw drop, showing their character’s mouth dropping way beyond realism - often literally to the floor.

11. Solid Drawing:

    - Solid drawing in animation is one of the more difficult principles to get right, especially in traditional animation.
    - This is because you need to make your creations feel 3D and give them weight and volume.
    - Art classes are useful to give you deeper knowledge of weight, balance, gravity, light, shadow and more.

12. Appeal:
    - In film, TV and theatre, directors want their actors to have charisma. It doesn’t matter whether they’re a hero or villain - the characters should be interesting enough to make viewers want to know how their story develops.
    - Animators should give all their creations appeal, whether it’s a cute caterpillar or a dragon hell-bent on destruction.
    - There is no real formula, though a good idea for giving a creation the ‘awww’ factor is to make their face round and childlike. Heroes often have strong, angular and symmetrical features.
