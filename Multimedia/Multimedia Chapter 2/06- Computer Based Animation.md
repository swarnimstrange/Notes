# Computer Animation

- Generally, Computer animation is a visual digital display technology that processes the moving images on screen.
- It can be presented in form of any video or movie.
- it is based on keyframe concept.
- CGI -> Computer generated imaging 
- The key/main concept behind computer animation is to play the defined images at a faster rate to fool the viewer so that the viewer should interpret those images as a continuous motion of images.
- Computer Animation is a sub-part or say small part of computer graphics and animation.
- Computer based software simulate the process of moving the drawing.

- 4 basic steps in computer based animation -:

    - Input process -> first stage before the animation. Objects in images are designed or drawn before the animation process. theses images are put under keyframe and decide their position before the animation.
    - Composition Stage -> foreground and background images are designed, colors are combined to generate the individual frame for the final animation in this stage. 
    - In-between process -> the animation at movements from one position need a composition of frame with intermediate position in between the key-frame.
    - Changing Color -> for changing color it used clut in frame buffer
