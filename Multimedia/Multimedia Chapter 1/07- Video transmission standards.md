- HDTV -:
    - In HDTV both the video and the audio signals must be digitized by A/D converters and transmitted serially to the receiver.
    - Because of the very high frequency of video signals, special techniques must be used to transmit the video signal over a standard 6-MHz-bandwidth TV channel.
