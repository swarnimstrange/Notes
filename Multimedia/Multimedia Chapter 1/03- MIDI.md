# MIDI 

- MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard that describes a communications protocol, digital interface, and electrical connectors that connect a wide variety of electronic musical instruments, computers, and related audio devices for playing, editing, and recording music.
- A single MIDI cable can carry up to sixteen channels of MIDI data, each of which can be routed to a separate device.
- Each interaction with a key, button, knob or slider is converted into a MIDI event, which specifies musical instructions, such as a note's pitch, timing and loudness.

- The most important thing to understand about MIDI is that it is based on the idea of message-passing between devices (pieces of equipment or software). Imagine a common situation: you have a keyboard synthesizer and would like to record a sequence using the sounds that are in that synthesizer. You connect the computer and synthesizer so that they can communicate using the MIDI protocol, and start recording.
