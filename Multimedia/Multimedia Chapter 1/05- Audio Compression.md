# Audio Compression Techniques

- Pulse code modulation (PCM):

  - it is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals.
  - It is the standard form of digital audio in computers, compact discs, digital telephony and other digital audio applications.
  - In a PCM stream, the amplitude of the analog signal is sampled regularly at uniform intervals and each sample is quantized to the nearest value within a range of digital steps.

- Delta Modulation (DM):

  - Delta modulation (DM) is an analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog signal conversion technique used for transmission of voice information where quality is not of primary importance.
  - Delta modulation is the simplest form of differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) where the difference between successive samples is encoded into n-bit data streams.
  - In delta modulation, the transmitted data are reduced to a 1-bit data stream.
  - The Delta modulation signal is smaller than the Pulse Code Modulation system.

- DCPM :

  - Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) is a procedure of converting an analog into a digital signal in which an analog signal is sampled and then the difference between the actual sample value and its predicted value (predicted value is based on previous sample or samples) is quantized and then encoded forming a digital value.

- ADPCM :

  - Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) is a type of DPCM (Differential Pulse Code Modulation).
  - It is also a differential coding technique that uses differential values like DPCM.
  - ADPCM was developed to overcome the drawbacks of the DPCM (Differential Pulse Code Modulation) and DM (Delta Modulation).
  - Unlike DPCM, the signal variation in ADPCM helps to change the step size of the quantization levels. It reduces the overload error during the modulation process.

- MPEG :

  - MPEG compression is of the lossy type and strives to reduce file size while maintaining the highest video and audio quality possible.
  - MPEG-1 stands for Motion Picture Experts Group – 1. The MPEG-1 codec was finalized in 1991 and it’s one of the earliest AV compression standards.
  - MPEG-1 compression is popularly used in VCD (Video Compact Disc). VCDs can support a bitrate of up to 1500 kbps but is usually in the range of 1000 kbps to 1100 kbps.
  - MPEG-2 comes with any of the following file extensions: TS, VOB, MPG, MPEG, MPA (audio) M2V, and MP2 (audio).
  - MPEG-2 compression is popularly used in the transmission of digital video signals for over-the-air, satellite, and cable digital TV broadcasts.
