# Audio File Format

- Uncompressed Audio Format:

  - PCM ->

    - It stands for Pulse-Code Modulation.
    - It represents raw analog audio signals in digital form.
    - To convert analog signal into digital signal it has to be recorded at a particular interval.
    - Hence it has sampling rate and bit rate (bits used to represent each sample).
    - It a exact representation of the analog sound and do not involve compression.
    - It is the most common audio format used in CDs and DVDs

  - WAV –>

    - It stands for Waveform Audio File Format.
    - It was developed by Microsoft and IBM in 1991.
    - It is just a Windows container for audio formats.
    - That means that a WAV file can contain compressed audio.
    - Most WAV files contain uncompressed audio in PCM format.
    - It is just a wrapper. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac.

  - AIFF ->
    - It stands for Audio Interchange File Format.
    - It was developed by Apple for Mac systems in 1988.
    - Like WAV files, AIFF files can contain multiple kinds of audio.
    - It contain uncompressed audio in PCM format.
    - It is just a wrapper for the PCM encoding.
    - It is compatible with both Windows and Mac.

- Lossy Compressed Format:

  - MP3 –>

    - It stands for MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3.
    - It was released in 1993 and became popular.
    - It is most popular audio format for music files.
    - Main aim of MP3 is to remove all those sounds which not hearable or less noticeable by humans ears.
    - Hence making size of music file small.
    - MP3 is like universal format which is compatible almost every device.

  - AAC –>

    - It stands for Advanced Audio Coding.
    - It was developed in 1997 after MP3.
    - The compression algorithm used by AAC is much more complex and advanced than MP3, so when compared a particular audio file in MP3 and AAC formats at the same bitrate, the AAC one will generally have better sound quality.
    - It is the standard audio compression method used by YouTube, Android, iOS, iTunes, and PlayStations.

  - WMA –>

    - It stands for Windows Media Audio.
    - It was released in 1999.
    - It was designed to remove some of the flaws of MP3 compression method.
    - In terms of quality it is better than MP3. But is not widely used.

  - OGG ->
    - An OGG file is an audio file, similar to an .MP3 file, that typically stores music.
    - It contains audio data saved in the Ogg container format and compressed with Vorbis audio compression.
    - OGG files may also include song metadata, such as artist information and track data.

- Lossless compression:

  - FLAC –>

    - It stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec.
    - It can compress a source file by up to 50% without losing data.
    - It is most popular in its category and is open-source.

  - ALAC –>

    - It stands for Apple Lossless Audio Codec.
    - It was launched in 2004 and became free after 2011.
    - It was developed by Apple.

  - WMA –>
    - It stands for Windows Media Audio.
    - But it is least efficient in term of compression and is not open-source.
    - It has limited hardware support.
