# Psychoacoustics

- the branch of psychophysics involving the scientific study of sound perception and audiology—how humans perceive various sounds.
- More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the psychological responses associated with sound (including noise, speech, and music).
- including psychology, acoustics, electronic engineering, physics, biology, physiology, and computer science.

- Psychoacoustics primarily deals with two areas namely -:

  - Perception -> tells us about the various sensory systems and their function in perceiving sound waves.
  - Cognition –> This area shows how our brain processes the perceived sound.

- perception -> Sound waves reach our ears as mechanical waves. However, our inner ear converts these waves to neural stimuli for our brain’s reception which results in the perception of sound.
- Limits Of Perception -:

  - The pitch of the sound (high or low) – measured in terms of Hertz(Hz)
  - The loudness of sound – measured in terms of decibels (dB)
  - Frequencies below 20 Hz are known as ‘infrasounds.’ We don’t perceive these sounds as a unified tone.
  - These frequencies disappear entirely; hence these sounds are generally harder to hear.

- Sound Localization -> Our ability to locate the source of a sound is called sound localization. Our brain computes the discrepancies in tone, pitch and timing of sound waves reception between both ears to deduce the source location.
