- Social network analysis has emerged as a key technique in modern sociology.It has also gained significant popularity in the following - anthropology, biology, demography, communication studies etc.

- degree of a node -: no. of edges it has

- path length -: distance between two nodes.

- centrality -: a key node that joins several networks

- density -: actual direct connection vs total no of connection

- closeness -: average length of the shortest path between the nodes and other nodes

- betweenness -: refers to the no. of times a node acts as bridge along shortest path
