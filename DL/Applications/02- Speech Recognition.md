# Speech Recognition

- Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is a capability which enables a program to process human speech into a written format.

- While it’s commonly confused with voice recognition, speech recognition focuses on the translation of speech from a verbal format to a text one whereas voice recognition just seeks to identify an individual user’s voice.

- Speech recognition works by using algorithms through a process referred to as language and acoustic modeling -:

  - Acoustic modeling is used to represent the relationship between audio signals and linguistic units of speech.

  - Contrarily, language modeling matches sounds together with word sequences to help distinguish between similar-sounding words or phrases.

- The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy.

- Many smartphone and computer devices on the market today come with some form of speech recognition technology built into their software.

# key features of effective speech recognition

- Language weighting – language weighting improves precision by weighting specific words that are spoken frequently (such as industry jargon or the name of a specific product) beyond terms used in everyday language.

- Speaker labeling – speaker labeling outputs a transcription that tags or cites a speaker’s individual contribution to a conversation with multiple participants.

- Acoustics training – acoustics training will enable the system to adapt to an acoustic environment such as the ambient noise in a busy office setting. Furthermore, it will also pick up speaker styles like pace, volume, and voice pitch.

- Profanity filtering – profanity filtering can be used to identify and censor certain words in an attempt to sanitize speech output.
