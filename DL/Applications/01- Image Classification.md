# Image Classification

- In recent times, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has become one of the strongest proponents of Deep Learning.

- One popular application of these Convolutional Networks is Image Classification.

- In general, Image Classification is defined as the task in which we give an image as the input to a model built using a specific algorithm that outputs the class or the probability of the class that the image belongs to.

-  This process in which we label an image to a particular class is called Supervised Learning. 

- Now for Image Classification, the computer will look for the features at the base level.
