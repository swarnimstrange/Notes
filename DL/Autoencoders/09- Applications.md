# Application of Autoencoders

- Image colouring -:

  - can convert black and white to color image
  - depending on what is the image and typical colors of it, it is possible to colour the image

- feature extraction -:

  - AE extract only the required features of an image and generate the output by removing any noise or unnecessary interruption.
  - they can be used for compression.

- dimentionality reduction -:

  - reconstructed feature is simiar to the input but with reduced dimensions.
  - it helps in providing the similar image with a reduced number of pixels

- denoising image -:

  - used to reconstruct the image by eliminitaing the noise from the input image

- representational learning -:
