# Representational Learning

- Feature Learning or Representational Learning is a set of techniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classifiication for raw data.

- It replaces manual feature engineerning.

- when we say " representational learning ", it means machine learning in which the goal is to learn to transform data from its original representation to a new representation that retains information (features) essential to objects that are of interest to us, while discarding other information (features).

- representations in a computer consist of sequences of binary digits, or bits, organized into floating point numbers.
