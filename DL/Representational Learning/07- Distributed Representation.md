# Distributed Representation

- Distributed representations is often central to deep learning, particularly as it applies to natural language tasks.

- a vector that represents some peice of data.

- one type of representation is naming each shape and giving it representation like horizontal rectangle, vertical rectangle etc.

- but distributed representation is naming their properties mostly like horizotal, vetical, rectangle, eclipse

- in the first representation, it doesn't provide any information about how these shapes relate to each other.

-but DR have the ability to capture meaningful "semantic similarity" between data through concepts.

- now the "memory units" contain information about both an individual shape and how each shape relates to each other.

- finding a good representation of your data is critical to the success of downstream tasks like classification or clustering.
