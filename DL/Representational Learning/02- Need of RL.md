# Need of Representational Learning

- feature engineering is a way to take advantage of human creativity and prior knowledge to compensate for that weakness

- to expand the scope and ease of applicability of machine learning. it be nice if we could automatically discover from the dataset what features are important.

- In RL, data is sent into the machine, and it learns the representation on it's own. It makes it easier to discover patterns and anomalies for a better understanding of data's overall behaviour.
