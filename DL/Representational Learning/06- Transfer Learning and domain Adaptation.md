# Transfer Learning and domain Adaptation

- domain -: "domain" is a sphere of knowledge. it is defined as the set of elements to which a mathematical logical variable or function is limited specifically.

- task -: "task" is assigned piece of work often to be finished within a certain time. In ML,we need the trained ml model to carry out for you.

- humans have an inherent ability to transfer knowledge across tasks. knowledge while learning about one task can be utilise in the same way to solve related tasks. 

- the more related, the easier to transfer and cross-utilize knowledge.

- transfer learning enables you to adapt or transfer the knowledge acquired from one set of tasks and/or domains to a different set of tasks and/or domain.

- it means that a model trained with massive resources, including data, computer power, time, and cost can be fine tuned and reused in new settings at a fraction of the original resource requirement.

- transfer learning and domain adaptation refer to the situation where what has been learned in one setting is exploited to improve generalisation in another setting.

- for example cats and dogs in first setting, ants and wasps in second setting. if there is significantly more data in the first setting then that may help to learn representations that are useful to quickly generalise only very few example drawn from p2.

- in the related case of domain adaptation, the task remains the same between each setting, but the input distribution is slightly differnt.

- for example -:
    - consider the task of sentiment analysis, which consists of determining whether a comment expresses positive or negative sentiment. 

    - a domain adaptation scenario can arise when a sentiment predictor trained on customer reviews of media content, such as book, videos and music is later used to analyse comment about consumer electronics such as television, tablets etc.

# Advantages of Transfer Learning

- improved baseline performance
- model-development time.
- improved final performance
