# Product based approach

- It consists of producing a product breakdown structure (PBS)

- PBS shows how a system can be broken into different products for development.

- It indicated Product Flow Diagram (PFD) i.e for each product, which other products are required as inputs.

- this approach is specially suitable if using a methodology, such as SSADM, which clearly specifies, for each or task, each of the products required and the activities required to produce it.
