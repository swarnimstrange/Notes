# Data Modeling

- The integration of multimedia data into TIR is not an easy task bcoz-;
    - MD is very different from Conventional data. usually not encoded into proper schema.

- A data model should be defined by which the user can specify the data to be stored in the system i.e both conventional and multimedia data types and provides method to-:
    - retrive
    - analyze
    - query

- The system should provide a model for the internal representation of multimedia data.

- the main goal of MIR is to efficiently perform retrieval based on user request by not only exploiting data attributes but also content of multimedia objects.

# Problems in Data Modeling

- The possibility of defining abstract data types inside the relational model allows one to define ad-hoc data types for multimedia data.
- Second problem is how to represent MD inside the system
- it is not sufficient to describe MD through a set of attributes 
- Features can be assigned to MO can either be Manually or Automatically by system. Normal Hybrid concept is used by which the system determines some of the values and user corrects.
- Feature extraction cannot be precise. uncertain assigning of weights.
