- Associated with -:
    - storage
    - indexing
    - search
    - delivery
    of multimedia data (MD) such as images videos etc.

- functions of multimedia IR-:
    - represent and store MD in a way that insures fast retrieval.

    - peculiar characterstics of MD.
    - kinds of operations to be performed on such data

- Challenges of MDIR -:
    - Heterogeneity of data.
    - Fuzziness of Information.
    - Loss of informaton in creation of indexes.
    - need an interactive refinement of query result.
