# Query Languages

- in relational or Object dBS queries are based on exact matching.
- only return those which satisfies well specified criteria given in the query.
- user should be able to query the content of MD by specifying proper predicates.
- so exact matching is one of the ways of querying MO.
- similarity based approach is also popular in which it takes into account the structure and content of the objects.
- content based queries (retrive MO depending on their global Content.)
- info on global content is not represented as attribute values.
- Instead of that a set of Information called as features is extracted and maintained for each object.

- Two different interfaces for quering multimedia objects -:

  - Interface based on Browsing and Navigation
  - Based on Traditional DBMS

- Conditions on Multimedia Data
  - Atrribute Predicate -> by quering these predicates the system retrieves exact match retrieval.
  - Structural Predicate ->
    - based on structure of MD
    - find video clip
  - Semantic Predicate ->
    - queries data depending on the features that have been extracted
    - Find all the blue houses
