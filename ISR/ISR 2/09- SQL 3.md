# SQL 3

- SQL3 was accepted as the new standard for SQL in 1999.
- It contains Data definition and Management techniques from Object oriented DBMS.
- super of SQL/92, add new constructs too
- provides support for extensible type system (means user-dependent data type is provided by system)
- Strong Form of encapsulation is provided (attribute value can only be accessed by using some system functions)

Drawback of SQL 3-:

- content based search is application dependent. Objects are not ranked so returned to application.
- Specialized indexing tehniques are not transparent to the user.
- NO IR techniques are integrated into SQL3 query processor.
