# One dimentional Time series

- we will give case studies of steps 2 and 3 of GEMINI using-:

  - One dimentional Time series
  - Two dimentional Color images

- distance function D()

- the goal of One-D TS is to search a collection (equal-length) time series, to find the ones that are similar to desirable TS.
- for example -: "Find the stock price yearly movement which is similar to of IBM"

- time series is a sequence of real numbers, representing the real variables on equal time intervals.
- for example -: Stock prices, Temprature data

- this type of database is a collection of large number of time series data.

- time series data can be depicted using similarity distance. the more closer a time series object is to a given query the more similar it is to the user's need.

- Time series data have high complexity. the high complexity makes it harder to fetch. So, the complexity of time series data can be reduced by transformin it to lower dimensional space.
